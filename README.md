# OCLSharp
A library that converts C# code to OpenCL and allows "emulating" the C# code as if is was OpenCL.

# Translator
The library comes with a translator class that translates kernels from C# to OpenCL. 

# Emulator
The library includes a "Emulation" feature that lets the user simulate the kernel on the CPU, allowing the use of breakpoints. The performance of the code when emulating is of course terrible, but good enough to debug it.
